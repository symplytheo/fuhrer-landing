            servers or with service providers. Personal information collected about you may be stored and/or processed

            providers may also store and process personal information outside your jurisdiction. We continue to have
            exclusive control over such data; however, when information is stored or processed outside your

            obligation. Your withdrawal may restrict our ability to provide the Services. There are limited
            circumstances in which we may collect, use or disclose personal information without your consent. They
            include: a) when the collection, use or disclosure of personal information is permitted or required by law;
            b) in an emergency that threatens an individual’s life, health or personal security; c) when the personal
            information is available from a public source; d) when we require legal advice from a lawyer; e) to collect
            debt; f) to protect ourselves from fraud; or g) to investigate an anticipated breach of an agreement or a
