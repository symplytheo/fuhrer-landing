              acts (such as temporary periods when the Service is taken off-line to make upgrades or improvements), or
              by events beyond Fuhrerapp’s control, such as power outages, telecommunications failures, war or civil
              unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God. Fuhrerapp may from time to time set limits on the value of
              Payments you may send (both individually and over some time), as well as the value of Payments any

          <strong>Authority to Charge Payment Account; Fees and Expenses</strong><br />
          <ol class="alpha-list">
            <li>
              To use these Services, you must use the Application to direct Fuhrerapp to Purchase the principal value of
              the services from your Payment Account, plus any applicable charges; by requesting a transaction, you
              authorize Fuhrerapp to charge your Payment Account for the principal amount of the requested transactions
              and applicable charges if any. You acknowledge that Fuhrerapp has no obligation to process or complete a
              requested Payment Fuhrerapp is unable for any reason to obtain authorization or settlement of the funds
              from your Payment Account for the principal amount of the requested Payments and all applicable charges.
            </li>

              Fuhrerapp will disclose its charges for providing the Service to you before you initiate a Payment.
              Fuhrerapp charges may change from time to time and may depend, among other factors, on the principal
              amount of your Payments, your type of Payment Account, your, and the bank Status of your Beneficiary. In
              addition to the charges, Fuhrerapp will also show you the current exchange rate (that is, the rate at
              which your money will be converted into the digital currency to be paid to your Wallet Account) applicable
              to your transactions before you send it. Fuhrerapp exchange rates change from time to time. In addition to
              the charges, you pay when sending a Payment, Fuhrerapp makes money when we convert the digital currency
              you send into the currency we pay to your Account.
            </li>
            <li>

              fees, or charges from his or her bank, mobile phone company, E-Wallet issuer or other parties to maintain
              or withdraw the funds.

            information. You represent and warrant to us that all information you enter into the Application or
            otherwise provide to Fuhrerapp is true and complete, including information about you, your Payment Account,
            and your Beneficiary. When processing a Payment, Fuhrerapp may rely on the registration information and
            Payment’s information that you provide, including information about your Beneficiary. You acknowledge that
            any errors in the information you provide, including misidentification of Beneficiary(s), incorrect or

        <li>
          <strong>Payment of Funds to Bene&iciary</strong><br />
          <ol class="alpha-list">
            <li>
              Fuhrerapp and/or Fuhrerapp designated service providers will arrange for the payments to your BeneQiciary.
              Fuhrerapp reserves the right to select the form of payment to the BeneQiciary. Fuhrerapp and/or Fuhrerapp
              designated service providers will use reasonable efforts to provide payment in a form requested, but the
              Fuhrerapp Application is not obligated to provide payment options for a speciQic Payment. Depending on the
              situation and the availability of various payment options, payment may be made using credit to a mobile
              wallet, currency (cash), check, transfers, mobile money, money order, P2P wallet, gift cards, stored value
              card, credit to a bank account or credit card account, or by some other payment instrument. Not all
              payment methods are available in all countries, and Fuhrerapp reserves the right to change payment method
              options. If a BeneQiciary cannot be located and identiQied, the Payment may be returned to you either by a
              credit to your Payment Account or other viable options at Fuhrerapp’s disposal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fuhrerapp reserves the right to establish identiQication and veriQication requirements for a BeneQiciary
              to receive a Payments. Fuhrerapp may rely, without further investigation, upon identiQication information
              or documentation provided by you or a BeneQiciary, including any code or identiQier number of the
              Payments, when paying the BeneQiciary. Fuhrerapp has the right to decline to pay the BeneQiciary if
              Fuhrerapp cannot verify the identity of the BeneQiciary or if Fuhrerapp believes that you or your
              BeneQiciary may violate this Agreement or any applicable laws, regulations, or Fuhrerapp’s policy.
              Although Fuhrerapp has the right to establish identiQication and veriQication requirements, and the
              BeneQiciary's failure to comply with them is a basis to decline payment of the Payments, Fuhrerapp has no
              obligation to establish any such requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Occasionally, customers may need to get refunds directly through Fuhrerapp. Such refunds received through
              Fuhrerapp is a privilege and not a right and will be processed based on the guidelines set below
              regardless of how long or how much. Unless otherwise stated or agreed to before completion of a
              transaction, most refunds are processed in the currency and at the rate at which the customer completed
              the initial order transaction or at a lower exchange rate as determined by the market but never at a
              higher exchange rate. If the customer does not agree to exchange such refunds at a rate at which the
              customer completed the initial order transaction or at a lower exchange rate as determined by the market
              but never at at a higher exchange rate the customer should have such refunds sent directly to them and not
              through Fuhrerapp as this terms-of-refund are not Qlexible. All refunds sent directly back to Fuhrerapp
              will be refunded in the original currency as paid by the customers less any administrative and handling
              fees of no greater than 1.5%. Fuhrerapp reserves the right to determine administrative and handling fees
              associated with a transaction after taking into account the time, fees, and resources required to complete
              the refund process after receiving such credit.

              for your Payments in effect at the time you initiate your Payments. Fuhrerapp will disclose the current
              exchange rate to you before you authorize the Payments. Fuhrerapp's exchange rates vary from time to time,
              and may also differ depending on the principal value of your Payments and other factors. In addition to
              the charges applicable to your Payments, Fuhrerapp makes money when your currency is converted into the
              currency in which your Payments are paid.
